                    <h2>About Me</h1>
                    <p>My name is Jordan, and I have always been interested in programming in general. I've tried my hand at creating websites, making lots of interesting tools, and designing simple games. This has given me some experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++. This portfolio is specifically going to be regarding the projects I've been working on throughout my time on a bootcamp programming course taught by The Developer Academy. I will be using this design as a base to make a portfolio of my personal projects in the future.</p>

                <div id="current-work">
                    <h2>My Current Work</h2>
                    <p>I currently work with Mattress Online as an apprentice on the web team. My main tasks recently have been associated with writing automated tests using Cypress, which has a JavaScript framework, and a lot of the projects I've worked on so far with this bootcamp has helped me in my everyday work, and I've been able to see significant progress in how I am thinking about and writing my tests. It's also given me a great basis for getting up to speed with the working life of a developer, and how teamwork and communication can be so important in such an environment.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="past-experience">
                    <h2>Past Experience</h2>
                    <p>Other than my current work, all of my IT and coding experience has really come from personal projects and playing around with things as a hobby. I did Astrophysics at university, and while I did do a couple of programming modules, the only other part of my degree that is relevant to me nowadays is the mathematical parts, which definitely helps with game design. After university I had a non-technical entry-level job, and spent a lot of my spare time trying to make websites and simple video games (along with playing lots of video games, which has given me a large amount of passion to eventually make a 'proper' game that I'd enjoy sitting down and playing for as long as I have sunk into some others).</p>

                <div id="portfolio-info">
                    <h2>About This Portfolio</h2>
                    <p>I've decided the best way for me to lay this portfolio out is likely to be giving each project its own individual page, and describing there how I tackled each task and screenshots of what I ended up with, along with any hurdles I encountered on the journey and how they were overcome. There will also be a link to each of the project repositories on GitHub, and the GitHub pages link for you to check out how things function for yourselves. I hope you enjoy my work.</p>
                    <p>Also, as a note, I will mention that this portfolio is not going to be hosted on a personal domain because I would like to create my own portfolio after the bootcamp is finished using this as a template, and I don't want to spend too much time finding non-copyrighted images and animations for all of the projects I've done so far. If any projects are to be included in my personal portfolio that is hosted elsewhere, rest assured that I will do my due diligence and make sure none of the content is stolen or copyrighted.</p>
